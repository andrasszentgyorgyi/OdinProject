This is my first HTML project for The Odin Project. 05/06/2025.

I built a basic website that showcases some recipes that I may or may not know how to cook in real life. The index page links to 3 different pages containing the recipes.

Overall I'm happy with my work. Finding free images was a bit of a hassle, but other than that I didn't get stuck on anything. So far so good.
